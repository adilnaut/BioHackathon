# BioHackathon Solution - Seqence Analysis S3XY p3opl3

Here is our solution for Sequence Analysis. I consist of several parts:
1. Sequence analysis algorithm written in C++
2. Data from publicly available sources: resrtriction enzymes, amino acids.
3. Web server with convinient UI and basic visualization.

Here is a link to our interactive demo! Please read notes above text inputs before running analysis.
